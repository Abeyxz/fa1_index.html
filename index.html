	      <h2>Morning Routine</h2>
	      <p>What do you think the start of your workday look like? What do you wear, where do you go, and what’s the environment like?</p>
	      <p>The start of my workday would be the presence of loads of patients. I wake up early morning to begin my routine. I take a bath and put my lab coat on and my clean scrub suit before I head to the hospital. I then check my schedule and deal with the animals afterwards. I see my team working in place and starting to stretching up themselves for the new challenge that is facing towards them. I then go to my office and drink my favorite coffee that I often have every morning. The place is loud and busy - overall chaos. You will hear dogs barking everywhere and cats meowing unpredictably. Though the place may be loud, all I see is responsibility and compassion for the animals who are in need. My job brings out joy and at the same time challenges when dealing with my patients. As the day progresses, I check various kinds of animals. Each visit has unique stories. Some would go for their regular checkups, others are for vaccinations, while others are for those who need urgent care. I then talk to their owners and explain the conditions of their pets. Sometimes, dealing with them is such a challenge, though it melts my heart to see animals recover and go home healthy. Each morning, I feel dedicated to doing my job because I love my job.</p>

	      <h2>A Story from My Dream Job</h2>
	      <p>Add an inspiring short story or describe a special moment from others who are already working your dream job — like solving a problem, helping someone, or doing something exciting in your job.</p>
	      <p>One interesting story that I heard from coming from a veterinarian was a dog named Bindi with a tumour on her front left leg that had been left to grow so enormous, literally the size of a football. The vet who encountered the condition of Bindi said that the dog was in terrible pain, so she discussed it with the owner, but refused to acknowledge the problem. However, she did not give up on encouraging the owners to let their dog in pain so she took Bindi to the vet. The doctor's reply was shocking. Upon the examination, Bindi had a tumour that was cancerous. The doctor left them with three options: remove the leg, try to remove the tumour or cut into her leg. Although this may be difficult but it is the only way that could help the sweet dog Bindi save her life. With the help of the team. they went on to conduct a six-hour-long journey of surgery to remove Bindi's tumour. After everything that happened, the journey of Bindi continued, and she lived happily ever after.</p>
